## Overview:
We have designed and built the 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱’𝘀 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 & 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗼𝘁 that only requires wheat and water to be filled in containers, stuffed parathas are made, 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗱, and stored in 𝗵𝗼𝘁𝗯𝗼𝘅𝗲𝘀 with 𝘀𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗜𝗢𝗧 control. The robot is low cost and would be similar to a 𝗺𝗶𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘄𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗻 in both size and cost.

## Key Achievements:
✦ 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝘆:
- BakerBot 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 the entire process, from dough preparation to stacking hot, freshly made parathas.

✦ 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲:
- Using an 𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗿𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗺𝗼𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗽𝗽, users specify the 𝗻𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗼𝗳 𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗶𝘀 or parathas and desired oil level, ensuring precision in every batch and remote operation.

✦ 𝗠𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗰 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗹:
- BakerBot's compact design houses sophisticated 𝗺𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗰 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀, including precise 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽𝘀, kneading, 𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴, flattening, and baking.

✦ 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗺𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
- 𝗜𝗼𝗧-𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 control and mechatronics system powered by an 𝗮𝗿𝗿𝗮𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗼𝗿𝘀 and 𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀, enables effortless operation with just a click from a mobile phone.

✦ 𝗦𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗼𝗿 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸:
- A sensor stack with 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘅𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝘆, IR, and 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 sensors, coupled with 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗽𝘂𝗺𝗽𝘀, endstops, and reed switches, achieves precise measurements and 𝗰𝗹𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗱-𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 for full automation.
